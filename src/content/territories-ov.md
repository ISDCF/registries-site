If you have a DCP and you need to determine its territory, use this table.  If you are creating a DCP and you need to know what code to use for a territory, use this table.  For countries not in this table, try the [IANA Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). Country codes are based on ISO 3166-1 country codes whenever possible.  Exceptions are denoted with a `Tag Scope`. 

For generic international versions you may replace the Territory and Rating codes in the CTT with:
- `INT-TD` to denote International Texted
- `INT-TL` to denote International Textless
