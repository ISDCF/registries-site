Terminology: The vocabulary of technical terms used in a particular field, subject, science, or art; nomenclature.
 
In the rapidly evolving field of technology, it is critical that the terms which provide the framework for standards, recommended practices, and developmental guidelines are clearly understood and consistently utilized. Establishing a common language is essential for ensuring effective communication and collaboration among professionals, which in turn facilitates a more harmonious path towards innovation, development, and interoperability.
 
Recognizing the importance of a standardized vocabulary, this comprehensive terminology registry has been developed. [This registry](https://registry-page.isdcf.com/terms/) serves as a centralized resource that encompasses the essential technical terms used within the cinema technology industry. It represents a collaborative effort between the [Inter-Society Digital Cinema Forum (ISDCF)](https://www.isdcf.com/), the [International Cinema Technology Association (ICTA)](https://internationalcinematechnologyassociation.com/), and hopefully… you, the industry professionals who contribute to its accuracy and comprehensiveness.
 
We encourage you to utilize and reference this registry in your technical documentation and industry references. By doing so, you help promote consistency and clarity across the industry. Furthermore, the registry is a living entity, evolving with the industry as new terms, definitions and innovations emerge. If you encounter a term that is not included or have a new term to propose, we invite you to submit it along with its definition using the [form provided below]((https://forms.gle/5AjbGtfnThZk9GAU7)).
