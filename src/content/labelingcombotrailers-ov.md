Although most trailers advertise a single movie, studios occasionally combine shorter versions of two different trailers into a single trailer that advertises the two separate movies.  In the past, studios have tried to use file names like: `Tron-2-Oceans_Combo-TLR-1` to indicate the two titles and the “combo” nature of the trailer. Obviously length issues and clarity of film name were problems.

For a while, the recommended way to label combo trailers was to use the “+” symbol between the words that denote each title.

Examples:

     Tron-2+Oceans_TLR-1
     AliceWon+Tron2_TLR-1
     AliceWon+Tron2_TLR-1-3D
     Sorc-App+Tron2_TLR-1

Some servers had trouble with the + symbol however, so the new recommendation is to use all CAPS for the title of each film and insert a lower case “n” between the titles.

Examples:

     CARSnMARS
     ALICEWONnOCEANS2
     PIRATES4nPROM

The lower case “n” indicates that the trailer is a combo.  Nowhere in the name does the word “combo” need to appear
