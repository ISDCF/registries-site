It’s important to add a version number after the Content Type code.  For example, feature version 2 would be “FTR-2”, etc.  This is important not only for selecting the correct version, but also for matching an “OV” with a “VF” version file (see [Standard and Package Types](standardandpkgtypes.html)). The Content Type field can also be expanded to add 2D or 3D identifiers (see [Labeling 3D Product](labeling3dproduct.html)) 

After the Content Type and Version number in the Content Type Field, you may add further descriptions or “Content Type Modifiers” in sub-fields separated by hyphens. For example: `POL-1-Temp-RedBand-TheatreChain-3D-6fl-48`

These are used “a la carte” only if needed, and must be used in this order with these value.
