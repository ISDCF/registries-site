* The Digital Cinema Name is divided into fields and sub-fields. Fields are separated by underscores.  
  * For example: `MovieTitle_FTR` etc.
* Within a field, hyphens separate information into sub-fields.
  * For example: `TLR-1-2D`.
* You should NEVER eliminate fields from a digital cinema package name since there are software programs that count fields in order to find and identify certain pieces of information.
* You can however eliminate the hyphenated sub-fields if you do not need the information.
  * For example, if you had `TLR-1-3D-4fl` in your Content Type field of a trailer package, you could choose to eliminate `4fl` if you mastered the trailer at only this one luminance.
* You should separate the words in your movieâ€™s title with initial caps.
  * For example: `MovieTitle` is correct.
* Do not use hyphens or underscores to separate the words of the title.
  * `Movie-Title` and `Movie_Title` are incorrect and can cause problems with some software.
