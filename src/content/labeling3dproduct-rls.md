**General Rules**:

1. If the movie is in 3D, “-3D” should appear in the Content Type field, and also in the Standard field after “IOP” or “SMPTE”.
2. If the movie is in 2D, it is not necessary to include “2D” in the Content Type field; it will just be assumed.
3. If the movie is in 3D, it will have both 3D and 2D trailers that need to be differentiated, so “2D” must appear in the Content Type field for the 2D trailer..
4. If (and only if) the Movie Title has “3D” in it, then 3D should still appear in the Movie Title field:  “StepUp3D“.
