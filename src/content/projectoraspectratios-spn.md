**SPECIAL NOTE:** Never use this labeling device with Trailers!

Trailers are almost always produced in both Flat and Scope versions regardless of the aspect ratio of the feature advertised.  Quite often, the “non-native” format of the trailer is letterboxed or pillar-boxed.  These “cross aspect ratio” trailers should never be identified using this method (`F-239` or `S-185`) since theatres should not be encouraged to change masking for a single trailer on the playlist or this could inadvertently spoil the needed masking for the feature.  (Changing masking from trailer to trailer is not practical.)
