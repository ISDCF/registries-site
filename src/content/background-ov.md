## The Problem

Some Digital Cinema servers only show a limited number of characters on their display screens. If the title of a composition is long, much of the information may be cut off or not visible unless you scroll to a second page. This makes locating a specific composition difficult if you have multiple titles. It’s especially confusing when you have multiple trailers as well as the feature with the same name.

If a feature composition were labeled:

`Pirates_Of_The_Caribbean_At_World’s_End_Feature_2.39_English_Spanish_subtitles_United_States_Rated_PG-13_5.1_Audio_2K`

Then Digital Cinema Servers that only display 40 characters would only see:

`Pirates_Of_The_Caribbean_At_World’s_End_`

Is this the feature or a trailer?  Is it flat or scope?  What language is it?  No one can tell if the information is cut off.

## The Solution

The studios and the Inter-Society Digital Cinema Forum created a “Digital Cinema Naming Convention” to be used for the text that goes into the “ContentTitleText” element of a composition playlist. 

For those of you not familiar with the Naming Convention, it has two primary objectives:

1. to make as much information visible as possible
2. to display the information in a specific order — in assigned fields — so theatres will know where to look for specific information.  

To achieve these ends, most of the information is abbreviated — including the movie title if necessary — and most of the abbreviations are standardized.
