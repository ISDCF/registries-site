### 3D Glasses Cards

“Please Put Your 3D Glasses On Now” cards can be identified in several ways.  “3DGlassesGen” in the title field can be used to denote a generic card.

In this case, the Content Type field should contain the denotation for a transitional element, which is: `XSN`.

Example:
`3DGlassesGen_XSN_F`

Sometimes the card is designed for a specific film however, so the title of the movie should be used in the Title Field.  In this case, you can populate the Content Type field with:  “3D-Glasses” for clarity if you with.  (This does represent an exception to normal Content Type field protocol.)

Example:
`MovieTitle_3D-Glasses_F`
