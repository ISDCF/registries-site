Many DCPs now contain supplementary tracks with an assisted listening track (enhanced dialog), and/or supplementary audio description tracks. In addition, sign language video may also be present, contained in an audio track. The presence of these tracks should be indicated in the Audio Type field as follows:

`51-HI` = 5.1 audio with a supplemental Assisted Listening track.
`51-VI` = 5.1 audio with a supplemental Audio Description track.
`51-VI-SL` = 5.1 audio with both supplemental Audio Description Description and Sign Language tracks.
`51-HI-VI` = 5.1 audio with both Assisted Listening and Audio Description tracks.
`51-HI-VI-SL` = 5.1 audio with Assisted Listening, Audio Description and Sign Language tracks.
