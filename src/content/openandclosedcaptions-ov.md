Open and Closed Caption files are coded as “CCAP” for Closed Caption and “OCAP” for Open Caption.

If used, CCAP and/or OCAP should appear at the end of the Language field after a hyphen.

For example:

`MovieTitle_FTR-1_F_EN-EN-CCAP_US-G_51_2K_ST_20130515_FAC_IOP_VF`

*Note: The example above is a Version File (VF-1) that modifies an OV file in order to add the Closed Captions.  The language in the audio and the Closed Captions is the same. `EN` appears in both the audio and subtitle sections of the Language Field.*

The OV file this Version File would access (the FTR-1 OV) would be labeled without any language indication in the subtitle portion of the Language Field:

`MovieTitle_FTR-1_F_EN-XX_US-G_51_2K_ST_20130515_FAC_IOP_OV`
