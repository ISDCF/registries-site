- In DCNC, language codes are (mostly) based on ISO 639, whereas Composition Playlists use [IETF BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). Although in many cases the mapping is straightforward, BCP 47 allows for a wider range of possibilities (e.g. UN M.49 regions), some of which may be a better fit to the geographic region(s) where the content is to be distributed.
- By convention, ISO 639 language codes should appear in lower case (as opposed to country codes, which are capitalized). 
- Subtitles are either generated in the theatre by the Digital Cinema projector, or are burned into the image. If the Language Code is in `UPPER CASE`, the subtitles are generated in real time by the projection system. If the Language Code is `lower case`, the subtitles are burned into the image.
