The Studio codes are 2–4 character codes that represent the studio or content creator of the material. This is helpful if a theatre or distribution entity does not immediately recognize the title in the file name and has a question regarding the material. The codes are often but not always based on ISCI codes. They are determined by the individual studios and can be changed at any time by the studios 

**If you want to add your studio to this list:**

1) Pick a 2-3 letter code that IS NOT BEING USED by another facility
2) Enter your information on [THIS STUDIO APPLICATION FORM](https://forms.gle/CwGvusenTtDHvXHK8)
3) Give us a few days and check the list to see if you have been added AND IF THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT! (It’s a manual entry process and sometime we mess up.) If it needs correcting or has not posted, please email <digitalcinemanaming@isdcf.com>. 

***NOTE 1:** If we happen to be on vacation it may take up to 2 weeks to add your studio. Sometimes you get same day service!*
***NOTE 2:** Once entered (and used) Studio Codes are not removed. We can deprecate codes. We won’t delete any code or re-assign to a different facility.*

Questions? Contact <digitalcinemanaming@isdcf.com>. If you don’t hear back in a week, please ping us again (vacations sometimes loose requests).

*NOTE: This is NOT an endorsement or qualification of these studios. These studios have self-added themselves to the list. This list is provided for convenience only.*
