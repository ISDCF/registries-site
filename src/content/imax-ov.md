IMAX DCPs (both 2D and 3D) must be differentiated from conventional DCPs. There are three places in the Naming Convention where this should be done: The Title, the Resolution, and the Facility Code.

If possible, `IMAX` should appear in the Title. The resolution should read: `2K` or `4K` as appropriate. `IMX` should appear in the Facility Code. Adding `IMAX` to the title may be difficult given the 14 character limit, so `IMX` can be used instead. Hyphens can also be eliminated if necessary.

Examples:

    TITLE-IMAX_FTR-1_F_EN-XX_US-G_51-EN_4K_ST_DATE_IMX
    TITLE-IMAX-3D_FTR-1_F_EN-XX_US-G_51-EN_2K_ST_DATE_IMX
    TITLE-IMAX-3D_TLR-1-3D_F_EN-XX_US-G_51-EN_4K_ST_DATE_IMX
    TITLE-IMAX-3D_TLR-1-2D_F_EN-XX_US-G_51-EN_2K_ST_DATE_IMX
    TITLE-IMX3D_TLR-1-2D_F_EN-XX_US-G_51-EN_4K_ST_DATE_IMX 

Since a 3D feature often has both a 2D and a 3D trailer, the stereo or monoscopic denotation needs to be in both the Title and the Content Type fields. If a 2D feature has only a 2D trailer, no `2D` denotation is necessary.
