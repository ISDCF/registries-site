Most Digital Cinema Packages are now being distributed in the SMPTE-DCP format.  Prior packages adhered to the Interop-DCP format. The design of these Interop packages adheres to a de facto standard that was common practice.  The industry has moved to the formal SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) standards.  This mainly impacts servers, not projectors; however, rendering of subtitles in the projectors may be affected.  In order to identify the construction of the package, the standard is explicitly denoted `IOP` for an Interop-DCP package and `SMPTE` for a SMPTE-DCP package.  Additionally, if the package is a 3D package the extension of `-3D` is added to the field.  This is done so that a quick check of the end of the file name indicates the standard and whether or not the package is in 3D.
