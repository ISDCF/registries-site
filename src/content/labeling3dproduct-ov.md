3D features often have both 2D and 3D versions.  3D features will also have both 2D and 3D trailers even if the feature doesn’t have a 2D version.  This can be confusing since the feature title will often have “3D” in the title.  (Example: `JAWS-3D`.)

Do not include “3D” in the Title Field unless “3D” is part of the movie’s title.  If the DCP is 3D, this is noted in the Content Type field as a modifier and at the end of the name in the Standard field:
`MovieTitle_FTR-3D_F_EN-XX_US_51-EN_2K_ST_20070115_FAC_IOP-3D_OV`
