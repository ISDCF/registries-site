The Facility field is useful as a record of which company packaged a given DCP. Facility names are abbreviated to 2–4 characters. The codes are selected by the individual facilities. The facility codes in the table below are added upon request by each company. New facilities are added often. This on-line registry is always the most up to date. Facilities are encouraged to update their entry for change of address, contact information or website updates. If there is a change of ownership a new code can be selected and the old code would be obsoleted and would point to the new code. Facilities that close may notify us as well to obsolete old codes. No code can be re-used. 

**If you want to add or modify your facility in the facility registry:**

1) Pick a 2-4 letter code that IS NOT BEING USED by another facility
2) Enter your information on [THIS FACILITY APPLICATION FORM](https://forms.gle/vVUytft8J6qQQFvd6)
3) Give us a few days and check the list to see if you have been added AND IF THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT! (It’s a manual entry process and sometime we mess up.) If it needs correcting or has not posted, please email <digitalcinemanaming@isdcf.com>. 

***NOTE 1:** If we happen to be on vacation it may take up to 2 weeks to add your facility. Sometimes you get same day service!*
***NOTE 2:** Once entered (and used) Facility Codes are not removed. We can deprecate codes. We won’t delete any code or re-assign to a different facility.*

Questions? Contact <digitalcinemanaming@isdcf.com>. If you don’t hear back in a week, please ping us again (vacations sometimes loose requests).

*NOTE: This is NOT an endorsement or qualification of these facilities. These facilities have self-added themselves to the list. This list is provided for convenience only.*
