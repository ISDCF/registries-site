The Facility field is useful as a record of which company packaged a given DCP. Facility names are abbreviated to 2–3 characters. The codes are determined by the individual facilities and can be changed at any time. The facility codes in the table below are added upon request by each company. New facilities are added often. This on-line registry is always the most up to date. 

**If you want to add your facility to this list:**

1) Pick a 2-4 letter code that IS NOT BEING USED by another facility
2) Enter your information on [THIS FACILITY APPLICATION FORM](https://forms.gle/vVUytft8J6qQQFvd6)
3) Give us a few days and check the list to see if you have been added AND IF THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT! (It’s a manual entry process and sometime we mess up.) If it needs correcting or has not posted, please email <digitalcinemanaming@isdcf.com>. 

***NOTE 1:** If we happen to be on vacation it may take up to 2 weeks to add your facility. Sometimes you get same day service!*
***NOTE 2:** Once entered (and used) Facility Codes are not removed. We can deprecate codes. We won’t delete any code or re-assign to a different facility.*

Questions? Contact <digitalcinemanaming@isdcf.com>. If you don’t hear back in a week, please ping us again (vacations sometimes loose requests).

*NOTE: This is NOT an endorsement or qualification of these facilities. These facilities have self-added themselves to the list. This list is provided for convenience only.*
